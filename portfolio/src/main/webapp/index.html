            <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
            <p> Welcome! I'm Sana and I am currently studying Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am most interested in the applications of nanotechnology in the fields of electrical and materials engineering. My past work opportunities have been quite diverse and unique. My experiences range from working in a research lab in Germany to interning at an engineering consulting firm in Toronto. That's just the start keep scrolling to learn even more about my experiences and interests! </p>

            <h2> KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY </h2>
            <p> Working abroad in Germany for four months was a fantastic experience. Not only did I gain technical skills, as I researched methods of printing Field Effect Transistors (FETs), but I had the opportunity to travel across Europe. I saw over 12 countries, gained hands on experience, and found my interest for electrical engineering. This internship was a dream!</p>

            <h2> ARUP ENGINEERING CONSULTING FIRM </h2>
            <p> At Arup I had the opportunity to learn so much about designing the electrical systems of a building or infastructure project! I gained experience in designing power distribution systems, lighting, and fire alarms for large scale projects. I utilized softwares such as Revit and Microstation in order to create these designs. Some of the projects I worked on included: 
                <ul class="feature-icons">
				    <li class="icon fa-plane">Toronto Pearson International Airport</li>
					<li class="icon fa-train">Finch West and Edmonton LRT</li>
					<li class="icon fa-gear">Canadian Canoe Museum</li>
					<li class="icon fa-university"> University of Toronto Science Building</li>

            <h2> TELEDYNE DALSA </h2>
             <p> While at Teledyne Dalsa I designed experimental setups to test the performance of camera sensors, and then used tools such as MatLab and Python to analyze the collected data. </p>

            <h2> BENDIX COMMERICAL VEHICLE SYSTEMS </h2>
            <p> Finally, my most recent internship experience was in Cleveland, Ohio. I worked on a project called Intellipark, where I helped design an intelligent parking brake system for commerical trucks. This system promotes driver safety and replaces traditional pneumatic dash valves. </p>
